# Model Directory

This directory contains saved model checkpoints for the HDP-HMM implementation.

## File Descriptions

- `hdp_hmm.pth`: The final trained model after completing the training process.
- `hdp_hmm_checkpoint.pth`: Intermediate checkpoint saved during training to enable resuming training from a specific point.

Note: These model files are not tracked in Git due to their size and binary nature. They are listed in `.gitignore` and should be regenerated locally by running the training scripts.
