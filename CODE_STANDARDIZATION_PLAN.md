# Code Standardization Plan

After running flake8 on the codebase, we've identified several categories of issues that need to be addressed:

## Issues Summary

1. **Line Length (E501)**: Many lines exceed the PEP 8 recommended line length of 79 characters.
2. **Whitespace Issues (W293, W291)**: Blank lines with whitespace and trailing whitespace.
3. **Import Issues (F401)**: Imported modules that are not used.
4. **Code Spacing (E302, E305)**: Incorrect number of blank lines between functions/classes.
5. **Undefined Names (F821)**: Variables used without being defined.
6. **Other Style Issues**: Missing whitespace after commas, missing newlines at end of files, etc.

## Standardization Process

### Step 1: Automated Fixes

Run the `fix_pep8.py` script to automatically fix many of the common issues:

```bash
cd /home/ralfahad/LatentDynamicsBayes
python fix_pep8.py -aa
```

The `-aa` flag enables aggressive fixes which will attempt to fix as many issues as possible automatically.

### Step 2: Manual Fixes

Some issues will need to be fixed manually:

1. **Undefined Variables (F821)**: In `hdp_hmm.py`, there are several undefined variables:
   - Line 50: `T` is undefined
   - Line 51: `T` is undefined
   - Line 52: `beta_weights` and `emission_probs` are undefined
   - Line 54: `T` is undefined
   - Line 55: `trans_probs` is undefined
   - Line 57: `emission_probs` is undefined
   - Line 59: `T` is undefined
   - Line 61: `T` is undefined
   - Line 64: `trans_probs` is undefined
   - Line 66: Redefinition of `update_states`

2. **Unused Imports (F401)**: Remove or use these imported modules:
   - `main.py`: `numpy as np`, `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `seaborn as sns`
   - `csv_processor.py`: `numpy as np`
   - `src/data/collector.py`: `numpy as np`
   - `src/data/processor.py`: `time`
   - `src/visualization/visualizer.py`: `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`

3. **Missing Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules following Google or NumPy style.

### Step 3: Verify Fixes

After making the changes, run flake8 again to verify that the issues have been fixed:

```bash
cd /home/ralfahad/LatentDynamicsBayes
flake8 .
```

### Step 4: Integrate with CI/CD

We've set up a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/flake8.yml` that will run flake8 on all push and pull requests to the main branch. This will help ensure that new code adheres to the standards.

## Future Maintenance

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Consider setting up pre-commit hooks to ensure code meets standards before committing.

2. **Code Reviews**: Include code style checks as part of your code review process.

3. **Documentation**: Keep the `CODE_STANDARDS.md` file updated with any new standards or guidelines.
