# Plots Directory

This directory contains visualization outputs generated by the HDP-HMM model during training and inference.

## Directory Structure

- `composite_viz/`: Combined visualizations showing multiple aspects of the model
- `learning_curve/`: Plots showing the model's learning progress over time
- `state_evolution/`: Visualizations of how states are created, merged, or deleted during training
- `state_patterns/`: Visualizations showing the characteristic patterns of each discovered state
- `state_tiles/`: Tiled visualization of all states
- `state_time_series/`: Time series plots for each individual state
- `state_time_series_summary/`: Summary visualizations of time series data by state

## File Naming Conventions

- `*_latest.png`: The most recent version of a visualization generated during live training
- `final_*.png`: The final version of a visualization after training completion
- `*.csv` and `*.npy`: Data files containing the underlying data for some visualizations

Note: These files are not tracked in Git due to their size and regenerative nature. They are listed in `.gitignore` and will be regenerated when running the visualization scripts.
